      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Plant Wise was born out of a love for gardening and a desire to promote sustainable practices. 
        Our founder, Magdalena Redka, started this journey in her backyard, experimenting with different seeds and growing techniques. 
        Over the years, this passion has blossomed into a thriving community of gardeners who share knowledge, tips, and resources.
